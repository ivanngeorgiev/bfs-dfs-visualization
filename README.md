# bfs-dfs-visualization
An application used to visualize Breadth First Search and Depth First Search

#Features
#Draw black (unvisitable) squares
This mode is on by default when the script is ran. While it is active, the user can change the color of the buttons in the 20x20 grid from white to black and vice versa. Black squares will be unvisitable during an algorithm visualization.
#Pick a starting point (green square)
A feature which allows the user to pick a starting point which will be colored in green. Only one starting point can be chosen.
#Pick a finishing point (red square)
A feature which allows the user to pick a finishing point which will be colored in red. Only one finishing point can be chosen.
#Visualize the BFS Algorithm
Visualizes the BFS algorithm by starting from the green square. Blue squares represent the ones already visited, while purple squares are the ones currently in queue. If a path is found from the green to the red square it will be drawn in orange.
#Visualize the DFS Algorithm
Visualizes the DFS algorithm by starting from the green square. Blue squares represent the ones already visited, while purple squares are the ones currently in the stack. If a path is found from the green to the red square it will be drawn in orange.
#Clear the path
Turns all the blue, purple and orange squares white. Either this feature or the "Clear the canvas" feature must be acivated in order to continue using the application.  
#Clear the canvas
Turns all the squares white. Either this feature or the "Clear the path" feature must be acivated in order to continue using the application.
